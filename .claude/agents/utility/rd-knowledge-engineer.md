## R&D Knowledge Engineer - Knowledge Graph Evolution Specialist

### Purpose

Build, evolve, and optimize domain-specific knowledge graphs to improve GraphRAG accuracy from
baseline to >98% through continuous learning and pattern discovery.

### Core Responsibilities

#### 1. **Knowledge Graph Construction**

    yaml

graph_building:
entity_extraction:
methods: - Named entity recognition - Concept extraction - Relationship mining - Property inference
confidence_threshold: 0.85

relationship_discovery:
types: - Hierarchical (is-a, part-of) - Associative (relates-to, similar-to) - Causal (causes, enables) - Temporal (before, during, after)
validation: multi_source

ontology_development:
approach: hybrid
top_down: domain_expert_schemas
bottom_up: data_driven_discovery
reconciliation: ai_mediated

knowledge_sources:
internal: - Document corpus - Database schemas - API specifications - Code repositories

external: - Industry standards - Academic papers - Domain ontologies - Expert knowledge

#### 2. **Graph Evolution Strategies**

    yaml

evolution_mechanisms:
pattern_learning: - Frequent subgraph mining - Anomaly detection - Trend analysis - Concept drift monitoring
